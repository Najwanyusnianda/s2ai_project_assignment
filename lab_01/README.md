Step-by-Step Guideline for Running MTCNN on FaceScrub Dataset
```
**1. Introduction**

```
MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) is a popular deep learning-based
face detection algorithm. This guide explains how to use MTCNN for detecting faces from
the FaceScrub dataset and saving the detected face images using Python.
```
**2. Prerequisites**

dataset :[facescrub dataset](https://vintage.winklerbros.net/facescrub.html)
```
Before running the code, ensure you have the required libraries installed. Use the following
command to install missing dependencies:
```
```
pip install mtcnn tensorflow opencv-python imutils tqdm
```
```
Ensure your system has a properly configured TensorFlow environment with GPU support if
available.
```
**3. Understanding the Code**

```
The provided Python script performs the following tasks:
```
- Configures GPU settings for TensorFlow.
- Loads the MTCNN model.
- Iterates through images in the dataset directory.
- Detects faces in images.
- Extracts and saves the detected faces into a new directory.
**4. Step-by-Step Execution**

```
Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
```
```
The following libraries are required for the implementation:
from mtcnn import MTCNN
```
```
import tensorflow as tf
from imutils import paths
```
```
from tqdm import tqdm
```
```
import cv
import os
```

**Step 2: Configure GPU (if available)**

To use GPU for processing, configure TensorFlow to allow dynamic GPU memory
allocation:

os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "0"

config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto()

config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True

session = tf.compat.v1.Session(config=config)

**Step 3: Initialize MTCNN Detector**

Create an instance of the MTCNN face detector:

detector = MTCNN()

**Step 4: Load Image Paths**

Set the directory path where images are stored and retrieve the list of image paths:

dirpath = "new/training"

imagePaths = sorted(list(paths.list_images(dirpath)))

**Step 5: Process Each Image**

Iterate through each image in the dataset, detect faces, and save the cropped face images:

for imagePath in tqdm(imagePaths):

path_split = imagePath.split(os.sep)

name_actor = path_split[-2]

fn = path_split[-1]

fn = fn.split('.')

filename = fn[0]

fileformat = fn[1]

dirdest = "new_mtcnn/training/" + name_actor + "/"

if not os.path.exists(dirdest):

```
os.makedirs(dirdest)
```
image = cv2.cvtColor(cv2.imread(imagePath), cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

result = detector.detect_faces(image)

for i in range(len(result)):


```
bounding_box = result[i]['box']
keypoints = result[i]['keypoints']
```
```
bounding_box[0] = 0 if bounding_box[0] < 0 else bounding_box[0]
bounding_box[1] = 0 if bounding_box[1] < 0 else bounding_box[1]
```
```
path_save = dirdest + filename + "." + fileformat
img = image[bounding_box[1]:bounding_box[1] + bounding_box[3], \
bounding_box[0]:bounding_box[0] + bounding_box[2]]
cv2.imwrite(path_save, cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR))
```
```
Step 6: Verify the Output
```
```
Once the script completes execution, verify that the cropped face images are saved in the
directory:
new_mtcnn/training/{actor_name}/
```
```
where {actor_name} represents the subdirectory corresponding to each person in the
dataset.
```
**5. Notes and Considerations**
    - Ensure that the dataset directory (new/training) contains correctly structured images.
    - Adjust the bounding box settings if necessary to fine-tune face cropping.
    - Use visualization tools like OpenCV (cv2.imshow()) to inspect detected faces before
       saving.
    - If running on CPU, remove GPU configurations to avoid errors.
**6. Conclusion**

```
This guide provides a structured approach to using MTCNN for face detection on the
FaceScrub dataset. By following these steps, users can effectively detect, extract, and store
face images for further processing.
