# Performance Comparison of Face Recognition Models (Assignment 3)

The FaceScrub dataset is a real-world face dataset consisting of 107,818 face images of 530 male and female celebrities crawled from the Internet, with about 200 images per person. Reference and download links are available on http://vintage.winklerbros.net/facescrub.html


Please read about Deepface for more information about lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis (age, gender, emotion, and race) framework for Python. You are asked to understand, observe, and conduct small experiments about face verification using the Deepface library. Please read the module shared for the third class meeting. To find the Region of Interest (RoI), please use the Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) framework (https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn) discussed in the previous lab activities.

You need to select images randomly, with at least 20 images per person, a maximum of 200 unique faces. Prepare also 5 (five) images for validation and testing, respectively. Then, build a simple code or system using the Deepface library to verify your collected faces. Please define the metric that the library supports to measure similarity, such as cosine measures and Euclidian distance. Also, you need to determine your threshold of similarity. Also, report the cleaning process and how you verify faces.

Evaluate the performance based on the F1-score. If possible, please show the TP, FP, FN, TN, Precision, and Recall. Write a report for this assignment in a PDF format with a cover containing your name and student ID, which includes the following sections, and show some figures or images of your process:
